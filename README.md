Problem Statement 3: ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange
A Sustainable Step Towards Conscious Fashion

Overview:
In today’s world, fast fashion dominates—offering cheap, convenient, and ever-changing clothing options. However, this convenience comes at a significant environmental cost: overflowing landfills, excessive water consumption, and high carbon emissions. Many of us own clothes we no longer wear—not because they are damaged, but due to changes in style, size, or preference.

ReWear addresses this issue by creating a platform where clothes get a second life through community-driven exchange and redemption.

What is ReWear?
ReWear is a web-based platform that enables individuals to share, swap, and save. Users can upload photos of their unused clothes, and in return, they can either swap with others or earn points to redeem other pre-loved items.

This approach promotes sustainability by minimizing textile waste and encouraging conscious consumption.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Simple sign-up and login using email, with customizable user profiles and clothing preferences.

List & Earn: Users can list their unused clothing, add details such as condition and category, and earn points when items are claimed.

Browse & Swap: Search for clothing items based on size, style, and category. Swapping can be done directly or through a point-based redemption system.

Eco Dashboard: A visual representation of the environmental impact saved (e.g., liters of water, kilograms of CO₂) by using the platform.
Future enhancements may include real-time eco-metrics that calculate and display how many liters of water or CO₂ were saved per exchange—making the platform more transparent and credible.

Local Exchange Options: Users can choose between home delivery or local meet-ups to exchange items.
To build trust and safety, we plan to include basic safety measures, exchange guidelines, and possibly integrate trusted delivery partners or logistics support in future versions.

Why ReWear?
The fashion industry is one of the top polluters globally. ReWear aims to build a circular fashion economy—a system where resources are reused instead of wasted. It makes sustainable fashion accessible and rewarding, fostering small changes that contribute to large environmental benefits.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or Bootstrap):
→ No framework overhead. Easy to build responsive UI with minimal setup.

Backend: Flask (Python):
→ Lightweight, beginner-friendly web framework. Perfect for handling forms, APIs, and simple logic.

Database: SQLite (or Firebase Realtime Database if you prefer cloud sync):
→ SQLite is built-in and file-based — perfect for local/dev work. Firebase offers easy cloud integration with simple APIs.

Hosting: Render or Replit (alternatively GitHub Pages + Flask on Render):
→ Free or low-cost platforms that support both frontend and backend deployment without complex DevOps.

Future Roadmap:
Launching a dedicated mobile application

Introducing gamified features like swap streaks, badges, and eco-challenges

Implementing AI-based clothing recommendations tailored to user preferences

Partnering with NGOs and donation centers to expand reach and impact

Conclusion
ReWear is more than just a platform—it’s a movement toward responsible fashion. By turning unused clothes into shared resources, we help reduce textile waste, support sustainable habits, and build a community that values conscious living. With ReWear, yesterday’s outfit becomes tomorrow’s favorite—for someone else.
